            We donâ€™t really get the qualities we like in our peers with the
            feelings of jealousy or insecurity. That only makes us mentally
            weak. A healthier attitude is to applaud the qualities you like in
            your peers and recognize that these qualities are within you too,
            albeit in a seed form. With attention and practice, you can
            cultivate the same qualities and abilities in you. That is a growth
            mindset, the kind designed for success.
